## Let's learn to handle bounties

🦅
We follow the steps to take the selected reward and claim the payment

## Bounty Bot & Take

To interact with the bounty bot and manipulate its status, submit a comment containing only one of these commands:

### ::take

🎨
To assign a bounty we will have to write `(::take)` in the comment box of the selected bounty.
The due date of your assignment is the next 21st date UTC.

<IfcCard icon={"🎁"} title={"Taked bounty successfully"}>
  Hi,<b>YOUR_NAME</b>! Thanks for taking this bounty! The due date is <b>DATE_TIME</b>.
</IfcCard>

📜
If you've received a comment like this... Congratulations, you just took this bounty.

#### Requeriments:

### ::extend

🐣
Extend the due date by 21 days. Can only be done once.

#### Requeriments:

### ::freeze

✨
Freeze the bounty clock. The due date will be adjusted once the `!::unfreeze` is executed.
The bounty manager can use this while reviewing the works without decreasing the duration available for the assignee.

### ::done

🎓
Change the status of this bounty to done. If your tasks require you to create pull requests,
a PR title that either starts with the bounty ID or is exactly the same as the bounty name
will automatically do the same thing when merged.

#### Requeriments:

- Sender: Manager,
- Status: In progress

### ::undone

🧠
Change the status of this bounty to in progress. Use this if the bounty is marked as done by mistake.

#### Requeriments:

### ::drop

🎯
Give up on this bounty.

#### Requeriments:

- Sender: Assignee,
- Status: In progress

### ::expense::\_\_\_\_

🌈
After you’re done with the tasks, you need to submit an expense to IFC.js Open Collective.
To ensure the authenticity of the expense, you need to tell us the invoice number via this command.
Replace the **\_\_\_\_** with the invoice number (only the number).

#### Requeriments:

- Sender: Assignee,
- Status: Done

## Create Pull Request

You need to submit some Pull Request(PR) to complete the task, make sure that the last
and only the last PR has a title that either starts with the bounty ID or is exactly the
same as the bounty name.

## Generate Payment Request

⚡
This step is done through `Open Collective` if you still do not have your user you can
create it <a href="https://opencollective.com/create-account?next=%2F">here.</a>

☝
To generate a payment request linked to your user, you must be logged in and access your account.
You can do it through the following <a href="https://opencollective.com/ifcjs">link.</a>

🧊
Once the invoice is generated, we need the ID number to attach it to the command `::expense::`.
(E.g. ::expense::<b>ID_INVOICE</b>)

<IfcCard icon={"🥇"} title={"Pull Request Status"}>
  Thank you for the confirmation. We will proceed to review the expense. Once approved, payment will be scheduled
</IfcCard>

🚩🚩🚩
Your request is being studied, in case it is approved. We will send a message like this:

<IfcAlert>

</IfcAlert>
