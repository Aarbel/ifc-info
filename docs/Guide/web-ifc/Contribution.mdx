## Web-ifc guide

üë©‚Äçüíª **web-ifc** is a javascript library to read and write ifc files, at native speeds. **web-ifc** is part of the [ifc.js](https://ifcjs.github.io/info/) project, which aims to lower the threshold for developing open BIM applications.

### But I know nothing about the project!

üë©‚Äçüè´
Don't worry: if you want to participate, we will give **top priority to your onboarding** so that you can start using the library right away and help us with whatever you want.

## Cloning the repository locally

üìÅ
The first thing to do is to clone the repository to your local machine.<br/>Start by forking the project (click on fork button on the top right) and choosing yourself as the owner of the fork (if asked).<br/>Now go to the forked repository, click on code button (generally green in color) and copy the https URL.

üì¶ Now open terminal on your machine and change the current working directory to the location where you want to clone the directory.
Enter these commands:

```bash
    //Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier like this
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY

    //change the current directory and enter the cloned repository using cd, and then name of the repository like this
    cd web-ifc

    // Using git checkout -b will create a new branch and immediately switch to it
    git checkout -b Ôºúnew-branch-nameÔºû
    //<new-branch-name> -> name your branch exactly same as the bounty name or the name starts with bounty ID

    //Minimise this terminal instead of closing it
```

## Setting up the project

### Build it locally

```bash
    //To install web-ifc
    npm install web-ifc
```

## Quick setup

```JavaScript
//Use these in your project whenever needed not in the terminal right now
const WebIFC = require("web-ifc/web-ifc-api.js");

// initialize the API
const ifcApi = new WebIFC.IfcAPI();

// initialize the library
await ifcApi.Init();

// open a model from data
let modelID = ifcApi.OpenModel(/* IFC data as a string or UInt8Array */, /* optional settings object */, );

// the model is now loaded! use modelID to fetch geometry or properties
// checkout examples/usage for some details on how to read/write IFC

// close the model, all memory is freed
ifcApi.CloseModel(modelID);

```

See [examples](https://github.com/tomvandig/web-ifc/tree/main/examples/usage/src) for more details on how to use web-ifc.

## Building WASM module

### Setting up emscripten

üê£ The WASM library is built through emscripten, please see [the emscripten installation guide](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) for information on how to set up emscripten. Afterwards `emsdk_env` needs to be in your path(environment variable).

### WASM library

üåè Open the terminal again and run these commands:

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies. <br/>
Run `npm run setup-env` whenever you open a new terminal, this will set up the required emscripten environment variables for you to compile code. <br/>
Run `npm run build-release-all` to build a release version of the wasm binary and the accompanying web-ifc api. It will be placed in `./dist`. <br/>
Run `npm run dev` to launch a development server with a basic ifc file viewer.

## Writing code on it

### Using an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

üìù VS Code - You can install VS Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

### Compiler for code

üìö GCC with MinGW (for windows) - You can configure GCC C++ compiler from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw).
Clang (for macOS) - You can configure Clang compiler from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-clang-mac).

‚òù Although the primary focus of the library is to be used through WebAssembly in the browser/nodejs, the project can be used stand-alone as a c++ library or executable. See [here](https://github.com/tomvandig/web-ifc/blob/main/src/wasm/web-ifc-test.cpp) for a simple entry point to get started.

## Creating a submit pull request

üî¢ Open you terminal and enter these commands:

use `git status` to review your changes.<br/>
use `git checkout master` to checkout to master branch.<br/>
use `git pull` to sync your cloned repository with the origin repository.<br/>
use `git checkout <branch-name>` to go back to your working branch.<br/>
use `git pull` to sync with the the main branch.<br/>
use `git add .` to stage your changes.<br/>
use `git commit -m "type a message to display for changes" ` to commit the changes made.<br/>
use `git push` to push the changes to the main repository.

Now go to your github, inside the forked version of the repository.
You will see a notification on the right (if not click on pull requests) 'compare & pull request' (generally green color button), click on it.
Now describe the changes you made in short and click on 'create pull request'.
